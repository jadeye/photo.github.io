          <h3>What's this all about?</h3>

<p>The Photo Project photo hosting service that puts you in control. Import, archive, and organize your photos on your server or your personal cloud accounts such as Dropbox or Amazon S3. Your choice.</p>

<p>Some of the Photo Project's features include:

<ul>
<li><strong>Data ownership and portability.</strong> Choose to store your photos on your accounts at Amazon S3, Dropbox, or your local drive. It's up to you, and you can switch anytime.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile apps</strong> for Android and iOS so you can take your photos wherever you go</li>
<li><strong>Durability.</strong> Your photos aren't tied to any particular photo service. Switch between services, use more than one at a time, or stop without losing a photo.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's the photo service you never knew you wanted until it existed.</p>

<h3>What makes the Photo Project different than Flickr/Smugmug/Instagram/any other photo site?</h3>

<p>Normally you pay one company to store your photos and to provide services to share them. If they shut down or you decide you don't like their site anymore, the process of leaving and setting up somewhere new can be long and frustrating if you care about keeping your photos.</p>

<p>With the Photo Project you can switch between services, use more than one at a time, or stop using the service without losing a single photo.</p>

<h3>More from the Photo Project</h3>

<p>Your photos are more useful if you can interact with them outside your photo site. That's why we've made a lot of things besides the photo platform you can run on your own server. A few of those things include:

<ul>
<li>A RESTful API to build apps on and documentation examples</li>
<li>Mobile apps <a href="https://github.com/photo/mobile-android">for Android</a> and <a href="https://github.com/photo/mobile-ios">iOS</a></li>
<li>A set of libraries in PHP, Python, Java, Javascript, and more so you can get started faster</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/photo/export-flickr">A Flickr exporter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/photo/import">an importer</a> to import those files into your new site</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/photo/openphoto-wordpress">A WordPress plugin</a> for integrating your photos with your blog</li>
<li>...All released under the Apache 2.0 license so you can make them your own</li>
</ul>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/photo/frontend">download the latest version</a> from our Github page.</p>
